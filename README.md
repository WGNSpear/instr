List of All Commands and what they do:

- .login: Control User only, can only be ran in a DM channel, displays the instructions for getting the session

- .session <extracted_session>: Control User only, can only be ran in a DM channel, gets generated by the code from .login, never run this command with a malformed session, this could break a lot of stuff.

- .addserver <server_id>: Control User only, can be ran everywhere, adds a server to the whitelist. You can get the server id from: https://i.marnixbouhuis.nl/images/2018/07/14/aa7772e5c4c5eb70fc92f4be6f551684.png

- .delserver <server_id>: Control User only, can be ran everywhere, removes a server from the whitelist.

- .setchannel: Server Owner only, can only be ran in a text channel, sets the current channel as the output channel for the bot. Requires the server to be on the whitelist.
